Value Type :
NUM : is a double 
STR : is a string
BOOL : is a boolean

All Value can be an Expression, a variable, or an explicit Value
VAR : is only made of letter/ can only be of one type /need to be declared before being used. ex : ab, A, HelloWorld

Explicit value :
NUM : can be an integer, negative or decimal value. ex : 5, 0.3, -6.28
STR : is defined between double or simple quote. ex: "Hello", 'World'
BOOL : is defined by TRUE or FALSE

Expression : is made of values seperatade by Operator
an Expression cannot contain spaces

Operator:
AND,OR,DIF: 
take multiple BOOL and return a BOOL. (read from left to right)
ex: A&&B, TRUE||FALSE!A
EQUALS,LESS,LESSEQUALS,GREATER,GREATEREQUALS:
take 2 NUM and return a BOOL
ex: a==5, b<a, c<=3, 5>d, 6>=7
ADD,SUBSTRACT, MULTIPLY,DIVIDE:
take multiple NUM and return a NUM (read multiplication and division first then from right to left)
ex: 5*3+b , 9-c/4

Instruction : define a single line in the file
Command : is the first word of an instruction

InstructionBlock:
start when an Instruction start with a InstructionBlockCommand
and close with the first END instruction that doesn't close another command
Ex:
FOR i 10
...
IF TRUE
...
END (close IF instruction)
...
END (close FOR instruction)

InstructionBlockCommand:
IF BOOL: execute the blockInstruction if BOOL return true
WHILE BOOL: loop through the blockInstruction while BOOL return true
FOR VAR (NUM1) NUM2 (NUM3): define VAR at NUM1 or 0 if NUM1 is not given
Increment VAR with NUM3 or 1 if not given
loop though the blockInstruction while VAR<NUM2

MIRROR NUM1 NUM2 : create a temporary cursor opposite from the point NUM1 NUM2 that will do the same action as the selected cursor
MIRROR NUM1 NUM2 NUM3 NUM4 : create a temporary cursor that will do the opposite action as the selected cursor from the line define by the point NUM1 NUM2 and NUM3 NUM4
MIMIC NUM : create a temporary cursor positioned as the selected cursor that will do the same action as the cursor with NUM as it's id

Command :
NUM VAR NUM: define VAR with value NUM
STR VAR STR: define VAR with value STR
BOOL VAR BOOL:define VAR with value BOOL
DEL VAR: undefine VAR

CURSOR VAR: create and select a cursor with VAR as it's id
SELECT VAR: select a cursor with VAR as it's id
REMOVE: remove the cursor with VAR as it's id

(when a NUM is given with % it will change it's value to a percentage the size of the screen)
FWD NUM (%) : move the selected cursor NUM pixel in it's rotation and draw a line of it's movement
BWD NUM (%) : move the selected cursor NUM pixel in it's opposite rotation and draw a line of it's movement
TURN NUM : rotate the selected cursor NUM degree.
MOV NUM1 (%) NUM2 (%) : move the selected cursor relatively
POS NUM1 (%) NUM2 (%) : set the selected cursor position
HIDE/SHOW : hide or show the selected cursor
PRESS NUM (%): change the alpha value of the color being drawn
COLOR NUM1 NUM2 NUM3 : change the rgb value of the color being drawn
THICK NUM : change the thickness of the line being drawn
LOOKAT NUM : rotate the selected cursor so that it is looking at the cursor with NUM as it's id
LOOKAT NUM1 (%) NUM2 (%) : rotate the selected cursor so that it is looking at coordinate NUM1 NUM2
